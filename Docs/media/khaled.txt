This is the camera Ros package we need to install if you want to explore it 
https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros
Then we will try to calibrate the camera with the robot, I can take this opportunity to explain transformation matrices 
If all goes well we should be able to see 3d image with the robot simulation in rviz!

We will start with the one I sent 
We might also need to install this library manually 
https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense

My objective would be to set things up on the robot PC since this will be the one actually connected to the camera, but you can try replicating on your machines as well if you wish so

We will also need this package for the calibration part

this is the link for whycon as well

we only need to install it (install listed dependences, clone package, make in your workspace)
I have a python script ready that takes output from the marker detection and generate the estimated pose

This is a nice moveit tutorial summarising it's functionality
